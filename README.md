# Things I want the project to do
  I want to be able to customize my own workouts. This includes adding and deleting a workout.
  I want to be able to add sets and reps for a workout I select. It should let me delete both as well in case of a mistake.
  I want to be able to update the weight for each workout. I should be able to reset and delete this as well in case of mistakes.
  I want to be able to log my progress for each workout. At the end of each workout I would like to be able to see how much total weight I lifted for the entire workout. 
  I want to be able to see past logs of my progress for each workout.
